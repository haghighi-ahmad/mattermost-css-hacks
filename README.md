### Vazir font for Mattermost

This is a fork of the [Discourse CSS customizations for Mattermost](https://github.com/discourse/mattermost-css-hacks) used to change default font to [Vazir](http://rastikerdar.github.io/vazir-font/)

To build simply run `./build` a file called `./dist/custom_css.tar.gz` will be created.

Upload that plugin to Mattermost.
